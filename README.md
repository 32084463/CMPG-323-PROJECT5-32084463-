#Project OverView

The Connected Office Initiative (COI) encapsulates the use of IoT devices within the network, placed all over the office building, to collect and share the data that these devices gather. The data can be shared in different ways. One of which is through visualizations built into a report or dashboard. These reports or dashboards can be shared with different stakeholders, potentially with different levels of access applied. The COI has been advised that a good way to monitor the usage of their IoT devices would be through a report.  The report will be built in Power BI, as the organization already has all applicable licensing agreements in place with Microsoft, and the report is expected to allow all stakeholders to see the same information on the status of IoT device registrations on various platforms.

#Stakeholders 

The stakeholders will have a clear view on the data that was presented on the report as well as on how the data was visualised on the report. The report gives a simpler and great way to view data  as well as detailed in order to make a clear business decisions, becasuse of the data was potrayed in the report. its easy and simple to read much better than the way it was on excel.
